# Algorithms

### Case A: Connecting Houses and Batteries

In this part of the case, the problem is that the batteries and houses have to be connected while minimizing the total cost and satisfying the constraints specified for the case.
- Battery type and coordinates are given.
contains:
- Bat Migration
- k-Means
- Bat Propagation (population_based)

### Case B: Choosing, placing and moving the Batteries

In this part of the case, the type, location and amount of batteries are added optimization measures to the case.
- the type, location and total amount of batteries are free parameters
